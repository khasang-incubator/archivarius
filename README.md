###Feature description
The graphical user interface for database administration in Postgres Plus Standard Server is named pgAdmin (Postgres Studio if you are using Advanced Server). The capabilities and appearance of pgAdmin and Postgres Studio are the same, and both give you a quick and easy way to back up and restore Postgres Plus database objects.

The actual backup and restore operations are carried out by the Postgres Plus command line utility programs **pg_dump** and **pg_restore**. When you use pgAdmin to back up or restore database objects, pgAdmin builds and executes a command that calls the **pg_dump** program or the **pg_restore** program with the appropriate parameters. You can view the **pg_dump** or **pg_restore** command built and executed by pgAdmin to help you better understand the backup or restore operation performed, and also to serve as a training aid for running **pg_dump** and **pg_restore** on the command line without using pgAdmin.

*Archivarius web-application* is allows to you dumping your PostreSQL database using special class DatabaseBackup that contains two methods for file dumping at Linux and Windows operating systems that will help you to use **pg_dump** in automatic mode. Let's see it in details:
